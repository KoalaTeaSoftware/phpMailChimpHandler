# MailChimp Integration
This simply encapsulates a few simple interactions with MailChimp in some procedural-style code. 

## Installation
* Put the file into an appropriate place
* Require subscriberHandler.php
    - the mailchimpHandler.php is not really meant to be directly used, but, of course, it can be. Better to add to the subscriberHandler file.
    - It will not have any noticeable side-effects where it is included 

## Usage
* Call one of the functions in the subscriberHandler.php file.
** see the documentation that goes with those functions
